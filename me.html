                    <p1 class="eduBlurb">Hello! My name is Sahil Puthawala and I am currently a computer science student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 
                        My hobbies include playing games, reading, and learning about different topics that may interest me one day or another. 
                        I first started coding in my junior year of high school learning java in AP Computer Science A, and it has become my most used and so far favorite language to work in. 
                        Feel free to take a look around and learn more about me! Have a Great Day!
